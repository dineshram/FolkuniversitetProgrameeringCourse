Hei! 

Good luck mate. 


So basically I did roughly something like this for the curriculum:

   I - Basics (strings, lists, data structures, functions etc)
  II - GIT ( start to collaborate right away)
 III - Turtle 
  IV - Networks (HTTP, sockets, protocols)
   V - Turtle + Networks (Make games)

What made a great success was to divide and conquer.
Make the students that learn fast do more advanced stuff.
Always make them work together on a project with a scope they can manage during class.
And then at the end of the course they get a project
(typically: make a game with turtle and multiplayer)
where they have to do work between the lectures to be able to finish it.
And they have to collaborate online using github.
