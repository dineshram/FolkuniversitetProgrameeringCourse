Write a program that reads an integer from input, representing someone's age. If the age is 18 or larger, print outYou can vote. If the age is between 0 and 17 inclusive, print out Too young to vote. If the age is less than 0, print outYou are a time traveller.


Egg cartons each hold exactly 12 eggs. Write a program which reads an integer number of eggs from input(), then prints out two numbers: how many cartons can be filled by these eggs, and how many eggs will be left over.


This program takes two lines of input. The first line is a "starting time" expressed in a 24-hour clock with leading zeroes, like 08:30 or 14:07. The second line is a duration D in minutes. Print out what time it will be D minutes after the starting time. For example, for input

Design
---------

build one part at a time
solve some examples by hand
plan your code before you start writing it
write the code
test the examples that you have solved by hand
test additional examples including “borderline” and random cases



# create an empty address book dictionary
addressBook = {}

# read entries till an empty string
print
name = raw_input("Type the Name - leave blank to finish")
while name != "":
   entry = raw_input("Type the Street, Town, Phone. Leave blank to finish")
   addressBook[name] = entry
   name = raw_input("Type the Name - leave blank to finish")

# now ask for one to display
name = raw_input("Which name to display?(blank to finish)")
while name != "":
   print name, addressBook[name]
   name = raw_input("Which name to display?(blank to finish)")
